              <br />
              We were prompted to make a game for small children to be played at a Girl Scouts retreat. Squid Game was huge at the time, so we based our game and its aesthetic on the show to draw players in.
              <br />
              I created the front-end&apos;s styles, components, and signals, complete with persistent state management, hooks to our Flask &quot;High Scores&quot; back-end, and custom assets.
              <br />
              I also set up a manifest and service workers in order for our game to be a Progressive Web App. This allowed our users to pin the site to their home screens like a normal app, and play offline with local high scores.
              <br />
              Finally, I managed all the bells and whistles pertinent to our scope, including internal/external metadata, documentation, responsive design, and video production for remote presentation.

              This bot was a collaborative project with my friends to be used by other friends! We spun up a Python bot, made an API to hook-up to the site&apos;s back-end, and hosted the server on Linux.
              <br />
              CTRBot exists to streamline the Crash Team Ranking user experience by replacing the site&apos;s UI functionalities with command-based ones, as well as adding custom filtering options. This provides efficiency, reliability, and the ability to perform several site functions concurrently. Furthermore, this bot contains custom functionality such as track generation and custom track pools, to further act as a general-use competitive tool.
              <br />
              This bot was beta tested and utilized by hundreds of members of competitive CTR communities within discord. I led the development team of 2 other developers, teaching them Git, Python, Linux Operations, JSON, the works!
              <br />
              While the bot is now out of commission due to an inactive community, this was a very fun and fulfilling project. I love collaborating and making useful tools!
